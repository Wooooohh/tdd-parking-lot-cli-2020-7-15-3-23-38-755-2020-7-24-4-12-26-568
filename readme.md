Please read the story and do your implementation.

## Story 1

As a customer, I would like to give my car to a parking boy so that he can help me park a car to the parking lot.

AC1: The parking boy can park a car into the parking lot and returns a parking ticket. The customer can give the parking ticket back to the parking boy to fetch the car.

AC2: The parking boy can park multiple cars into on parking lot. And can fetch right car using correspond ticket.

AC3: If the customer gives a wrong ticket (the parking boy does not provide the ticket) or does not give a ticket. Then no car should be fetched.

AC4: If the customer gives a ticket that has already been used. Then no car should be fetched.

AC5: The parking lot has a capacity (the default capacity of a parking lot is 10). If there is no position, then the user cannot park the car into it. Thus (s)he will not get any ticket.

> There are some cases which are not a requirement but may happen technically 
>
> * Passing a parked car to a parking boy.
> * Passing a `null` car to a parking boy.

## Story 6

As a parking lot service manager, I would like to manage several parking boys (including all three kinds of parking boys). And at the same time, I can act as a standard parking boy too. So that our work can be most efficient.

Each parking lot service will have only one manager.

AC1. The parking lot service manager can add parking boys to management list. And the parking lot manager can specify a parking boy on the list to park or fetch the car (only from the parking lots managed by that parking boy).

AC2. The parking lot service manager can also manage parking lots. And (s)he can park or fetch the car just as a standard parking boy (*Story 3*). Note that (s)he can only store and fetch the car from his/her own parking lots.

AC3. If the manager tells the parking boy to park or fetch the car, then the manager should be able to display the error message to the customer if the parking boy failed to do the operation.
